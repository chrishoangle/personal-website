Hello everyone! I’m Christopher Le, a UCLA senior graduating Spring 2026. I build data‑driven models and tools at the intersection of inference and physical systems, with interests in aerospace and sustainability. In my free time, I enjoy exploring local city spots, embarking on solo travel, and attending indie music concerts, where I have the creative freedom to connect socially with people from diverse backgrounds and interests.
