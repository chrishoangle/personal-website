# **Temporal 3D Mapping of Deforming Translucent Surfaces**

- Context: Undergraduate research in optical systems and robotics deformation analysis
- Year: 2022 - present

## Problem

Existing 3D mapping methods like photogrammetry, LIDAR, and 3D scanning struggle with:

- Accurate real-time measurement of deformable soft robotics.
- Handling translucent or non-opaque surfaces

## Approach

- Designed a custom setup combining 2-axis motorized stage with laser displacement sensor
- Integrated stepper motors controlled via a microcontroller
- Began developing software to sync coordinate collection and motor control.

## Results

- System prototype under development of preliminary design.
- Presented research to American Physical Society (APS) March Conference

## My contribution

Programmed microcontroller for stepper motor control and sensor integration. 

Created system schematic and poster visualization.

## Tech

2-axis stepper motor platform, Arduino microcontroller, Laser displacement sensor

## Keywords

soft robotics, real-time tracking, optical measurement, deformation mapping, embedded systems, computer vision

## Demonstration
