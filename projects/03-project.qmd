# **Bidirectional Soft Actuator Voltage Control System**

Context: Embedded Timing & Signal Measurement Circuit Adaptive deformation control using MOSFET switching and PWM voltage modulation

Year: 2022-23

### **Problem**

Enable selective and variable deformation in different regions of a bidirectional soft robotic actuator by controlling voltage delivery to multiple channels from a single power source through voltage manipulation.

### **Approach**

Designed a multi-channel power distribution circuit using N-channel MOSFETs as high-side and low-side switches

Implemented pulse-width modulation (PWM) to produce different effective output voltages from a constant supply

Created an interface to independently modulate actuator regions, enabling tunable expansion patterns

Validated actuator deformation response under variable duty cycle control

### **Results**

Achieved smooth, fine-grain control of actuator shape and motion, allowing directional bending and surface profile changes without redesigning the actuator structure.
